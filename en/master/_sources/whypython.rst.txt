Code Templates
================

Python is widely-used in the sciences. It has a wide array of external 
libraries which we can access by importing them into our code (via an import 
statement). A library is just a package of code written by somebody else, which
contains usable functions for us to use. It is these libraries that give Python 
itâ€™s notable versatility. It is with these libraries that we will explore some science-driven 
computational projects. In this bootcamp, we focus on the libraries:

    - **NumPy**   
        Provides various numerical computing tools (random number generators, mathematical functions, etc.)
    - **Matplotlib**  
        Provides various interactive, data visualization tools (histograms, errorbars, scatterplots, curve fitting, etc.)
    - **SciPy**
        Provides varies resources for math, science, and engineering

On the Avenue course page for the Python bootcamp, there is a downloadable collection of code templates which guide students through
common data analysis tasks, including:

    - importing/exporting data from/to a file
    - generating random data and plotting it using a histogram
    - generating random data and fitting with a polynomial curve 
    - importing data from a file and fitting with any function
    - importing data (with +/- errors) from a file and plotting with errorbars
