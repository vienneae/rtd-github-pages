Python Basics
===============

At it’s most simple, a programming language is a set of instructions that a 
computer can read, and there are many to choose from. But regardless of the 
language (C, C++, Python, Java, C, JavaScript, Ruby, Haskell etc.), there are 
(mostly) always the same fundamental components present, and these are:

 1. Data Types and Variables    
 2. Operators                   
 3. Input/Output                
 4. Conditionals and Loops                        

All that learning a programming language comes down to is learning the unique 
syntax for each of these components. There is a plethora of online material 
devoted to teaching Python. I have listed some free resources for you to check out below.

Online Literature
--------------------
 
- |link1| 
    An extensive, but somewhat lengthier option. Chapters 1-8 cover the fundamentals with an average of 6000 words per chapter.
    Chapter 9-20 go on to cover more intermedite topics. Each chapter includes a set of practice questions.
- |link2| 
    A very stripped back and concise option. There are 7 sheets that aim to fit the primary syntax rules for the fundamental Python concepts.
    Best used as a quick aid while working on practice problem and/or actively programming. 
- |link3|  
    A moderate length option in a module format. There are 5 modules, although the basics of Python syntax are taught in module 2. The other
    modules go on to provide practice problems and teach intermediate concepts. Also, it has a focus on STEM applications.
- |link4|
    An outdated but still useful option. The only free content offered is a 12 lesson, interactive course on Python 2, which is a legacy 
    version of Python. This is a good resource if one doesn’t mind the constant teasing of PRO material, and the fact that learning Python 2 
    will eventually require the student to update their knowledge to Python 3 (There isn't a huge difference, but still noticeable).

Online Videos
----------------

- |link5|
        An in-depth option with lots of videos. Ep 1-4 cover setting up Python on Windows. Ep 5-33 cover Python fundamentals, which 
        an average episode length of 6 minutes. Later episodes go on to cover intermediate topics. There are two sequel series to this one,
        so if one enjoys the first series, they have much more similar content to look forward to.
- |link6| 
        This is a slightly more streamlined version of the Microsoft videos. Eps 2-9 cover Python fundamentals with videos at an average length
        of 20 minutes. There are 90+ other videos which explore intermediate topics.
- |link7| 
        Another great option. Consists of 60 episodes covered fundamental Python concepts and have an average video length of 10 minutes.
- |link8|  
        This website offers a large number of Python courses for beginners, ranging from 4 hours of lectures to 30 minutes.
        There are also shorter videos offered which go through and answer frequently asked questions regarding Python
