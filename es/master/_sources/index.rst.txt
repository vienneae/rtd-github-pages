Welcome To The Python Bootcamp For Science!
===========================================

The goal of this bootcamp is to provide students with a condensed introduction
to computation in the context of scientific data analysis. Early exposure to
computation is vital to ensuring that future scientists are ready to thrive in
our increasingly data-rich world. We'll use the programming language, Python, which
is widely-used and beginner friendly.

This bootcamp has three main sections, outlined below:


Getting Started
-----------------

Here students are guided through 
   - downloading Python
   - opening and navigating the command line
   - writing a simple program and running it

Enter :doc:`here for Mac users <macusers>` or :doc:`here for Windows users <windowsusers>`.



Learning The Basics Of Python
--------------------------------

Here students are provided with
   - the fundamental topics one should understand in order to learn a programming language
   - free Python learning resources
   - avenue quizzes to test knowledge

Enter :doc:`here <pythonbasics>`.



Python As A Tool For Science
-------------------------------

Here students are provided with
   - what makes Python so good for scientific computing
   - simple Python script templates to perform common data analysis tasks

Enter :doc:`here <whypython>`.
